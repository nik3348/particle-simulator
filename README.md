# Particle Simulator
This is just a simple attempt to model particle physics

## Problems
The main problem which I think I've encountered is Energy Drift where due to the innaccuracy of the velocities and forces the total energy of the system increases exponentially over time.

Another issue seems to lie framerate, since each frame is a second in the simulation, the problem that arises is when the particle moves too fast. At high speeds the particle can move a large distance in a single frame sometimes that distance is towards the nucleus as a result particles seem to phase through each other.

These 2 problems together have made it impossible to continue to make a simulation of particles.
